Code required for analyses:
1) environmental correlation.Rmd: runs correlation analysis for predictor variables across sample locations for Terra Nova and Gros Morne National Parks seperately and together
2) glm function.R: specifies family, link and variable structure for generalized linear models for carbon models and mature forest/gap models
3) c total glm.Rmd: runs and compares generalized linear models for carbon stocks
4) gap glm.Rmd: runs and compares generalized linear models for mature forest/gap
5) cross validation function.R: functions required to run cross validations repeatedely
6) c cross validation.Rmd: cross validation of top models from 3) 
7) gap cross validation.Rmd: cross validation of top models from 4)
8) predictable space.Rmd: creates stacked raster of predictor variables that only encompasses areas in which we have predictive power fro Terra Nova and Gros Morne National Parks
9) c predictions.Rmd: uses the top model from 6) to predict carbon stocks across 8)
10) gap predictions.Rmd: uses the top model from 7) to predict carbon stocks across 8)
11) c error propagation.Rmd: calculates 95% confidence intervals and prediction intervals for each cell in 6)
12) gap error propagation.Rmd: calculates 95% confidence intervals and prediction intervals for each cell in 7)
13) anova bw site types.Rmd: compares carbon stocks between sample locations in mature forest, previously disturbed forest without moose herbivory, and previously disturbed forest with moose herbivory
14) graphs.Rmd: creates manuscript figures 3, 5, and 6
15) c total glm cv both parks.Rmd: runs and compares generalized linear models for carbon stocks when parks are models together
16) gap glm cv both parks.Rmd: runs and compares generalized linear models for mature forest/gap when parks are models together
17) soil glm.Rmd: runs and compares generalized linear models for only soil carbon stocks
18) without GM 35.Rmd: runs and compares generalized linear models for carbon stocks when site GM_35_2023 is not included. The soil carbon for site GM_35_2023 was estimated according to Appendix 3
19) Exporting maps for figures.Rmd: creates maps used in Figure 4
