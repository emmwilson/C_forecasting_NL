## List of predictor variables

-   Forest height: FHT (m)

    range: 0 - 20

    year: 2019

-   Length of growing season: LGS (days)

    calculated by subtracting date of onset of greenness increase (15% increase in greeness) from onset greenness decrease (10% decrease in greenness)

    range: 28 - 244 days

    year: 2020

    \*there are quite a few spots without data

-   Canopy cover: cc (%)

    range: 0 - 100

    year:

    Terra Nova: 2010 with gaps filled in with 2005 (2015 had most of the park missing)

    Gros Morne: 2015 with gaps filled in with 2010

-   Enhanced vegetation index: EVI (NA)

    -   amplitude: EVIamp, maximum minus minimum EVI during that year "interpreted as indicating the degree to which the leaf life cycles of individual plants and species are synchronized" (Gerard et al. 2020)

    -   median: EVImed, median EVI during that year

    range: 16 - 9600

    year: 2019

-   Aspect: ASP (degrees)

    range: 0-360

    year: 2011

    \*when slope is 0 there can be no aspect, in these instances I put 0.01˚as aspect

-   Slope: SLO (percent)

    range: 0 - 260

-   Elevation: ELE (m)

-   Dominant species: SPC (categorical) \* decided to switch from dominant species to forest type because I didn't sample all dominant species

    range: 8 categories (CS = coniferous shrub, DS = deciduous shrub, NS = not sufficiently restocked, bf = balsam fir, bs = black spruce, tA = trembling aspen, tL = tamarack, wB = white birch)

    year: 2010

-   Land cover type: CEC_LCT (categorical)

    range: 5 categories (1 = temperate or sub-polar needle leaf forest, 6 = mixed forest, 8 = temperate or sub-polar shrubland, 14 = wetland, 16 = barrenland)

    year: 2020

-   Age class: FAC (categorical)

    range: 5 categories (1 = 0 - 20, 2 = 21 - 40, 3 = 41 - 60, 4 = 61 - 80, 5 = 81+)

### Conclusions

The patterns are quite consistent across each subset of the data.

My conclusions are predominantly based on the correlation charts, but I also am influenced a bit by the fact that none of the variance inflation factors are above 4.2, with most being below 2.

#### Remove CC

Canopy cover is very correlated with forest height. And although I have no biological reasoning for keeping forest height over canopy cover, the forest height data set is more complete and recent.

#### Remove FAC

The forest age is technically categorical, but the categories are ranges of a continuous variable. Is it ok to use it in a correlation chart?

If it is ok to use I propose removing FAC. It is very correlated with height. And I would prefer to keep height because it is actually a continuous variable.

#### Remove LCT

Land cover type is also actually a categorical variable so it's interesting that it is so correlated. It is probably because the higher numbers describe less vegetated land cover types (eg; 1 is temperate needle forest, 8 is shrubland and 16 is barrenland).

The only data we are really losing by removing it is whether the forested areas are needle leaf or mixed forest.

## Residual distributions from GzLMs

for full model in Gros Morne with C per m2 of each subplot used as response variable and a random effect of site. Predictor variables have been scaled.

C \~ FHT + EVIamp + EVImed + ELE + SLO + ASP + (1\|site_id)

## Linear Models

### subsetting data

#### park level

by park -\> GM and TN get own models

#### subplot or site

sites -\> average C per m2 across the 4 subplots at each site

subplots -\> use C per m2 of each subplot and have random effect of site to account for pseudoreplication

### structure

i.  log(C) \~ ε

ii. log(C) \~ (1\|site) + ε

iii. log(C) \~ all env. + ε

iv. log(C) \~ all env. + (1\|site) + ε

v.  log(C) \~ reduced env. + ε

vi. log(C) \~ reduced env. + (1\|site) + ε

vii. log(C) \~ univariate + ε
